# Pooling Layer

Spatial Pooling (also called subsampling or downsampling) reduces the dimensionality of each feature map but retains the most important information. Spatial Pooling can be of different types: Max, Average, Sum etc.

The goal of the pooling layer is to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control overfitting. There are several functions to implement pooling among which ***max pooling*** is the most common one. Pooling is often applied with filters of size 2x2 applied with a stride of 2 at every depth slice. A pooling layer of size 2x2 with stride of 2 shrinks the input image to a 1/4 of its original size.

In case of Max Pooling, we define a spatial neighborhood (for example, a 2Ã—2 window) and take the largest element from the rectified feature map within that window. Instead of taking the largest element we could also take the average (Average Pooling) or sum of all elements in that window. In practice, Max Pooling has been shown to work better.
